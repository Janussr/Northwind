# Project Description

#### This project is developed using the Northwind database in MSSQL and .NET Web API with Entity Framework Core.

## Introduction

#### The project utilizes the Northwind database, which is a sample database commonly used for learning and demonstration purposes. It is implemented in Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) and serves as the underlying data source for this project. The database contains tables representing various aspects of a fictional company's operations, such as customers, orders, products, and suppliers.

## Technology Stack

#### The project leverages the following technologies:

#### MSSQL: The database management system used to store and manage the Northwind database.
#### .NET Web API: A framework for building HTTP-based services using the .NET platform.
#### Entity Framework Core: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies database access and interaction.

## Project Structure

#### The project follows a typical structure for a .NET Web API project, with separate folders for controllers, models, and data access. The Entity Framework Core is used to interact with the database, and the controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and return appropriate responses.
